`1. Electricity Bill Calculation`  
`Problem Statement:`

   - `Up to 100 units` → ₹5 per unit  
   - `101 to 300 units` → ₹7 per unit  
   - `Above 300 units` → ₹10 per unit  
3. `If the total bill exceeds ₹1000, add a 5% surcharge.`  
4. The program should display 
`customer details, total units consumed, 
bill amount, and surcharge (if any).`
