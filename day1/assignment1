`1. Flight Ticket Booking System`  
`Scenario:`  
A travel agency wants to `store the details of N passengers` (Name, Age, Destination). 
The system should allow:  
- Adding a `new passenger`  
- `Sorting` passengers by `destination name (A-Z)`  
- Searching for passengers traveling to a specific destination  

Use `arrays` and implement `sorting and searching techniques`.

`Input Example:`  
```
Enter number of passengers: 3
Passenger 1: Alice, 30, Delhi
Passenger 2: Bob, 25, Mumbai
Passenger 3: Charlie, 40, Chennai

Sorted List (by destination):
Charlie - Chennai
Alice - Delhi
Bob - Mumbai

Enter destination to search: Mumbai
Passengers traveling to Mumbai: Bob
```
