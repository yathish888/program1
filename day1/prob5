2. Toll Tax Calculation for Vehicles`  
`Problem Statement:`  
A highway toll management system needs a program 
to calculate toll tax 
based on `vehicle type and distance traveled`:  

1. `Vehicle Type & Base Charges:`  
   - Car → ₹5 per km  
   - Truck → ₹10 per km  
   - Bus → ₹8 per km  
2. If a `truck` travels `more than 500 km`, a `10% discount` applies.  
3. If a `bus` travels `more than 300 km`, a `5% discount` applies.  

`Requirements:`  
1. `Input:`  
   - Vehicle Type (Car/Truck/Bus)  
   - Distance Traveled (km)  
2. `Output:`  
   - Total Toll Tax
